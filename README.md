  Internet of Things

  this going to be a respotory for stuff I, or the group I'm part of, working on -
  at least it's the plan for now. the main purpose is to separate my experimental
  abominations I put in "the dump" from more proper (hopefully) stuff made within
  the scope of my IoT-studies.
